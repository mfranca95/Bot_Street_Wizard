### Bot Street Wizard
Trade Smarter, Not Harder: Unleashing the Power of AI in Your Investment Journey.


# SCOPE OF PROJECT : 

This project attempts to deploy a trading bot to make stock predictions and create quarterly signals for investors to visualize potential returns. Giving advice based on three different investment strategies and, ultimately, providing recommendations for investors. We will also incorporate a user interface for people to input their allocation percentages of their assets towards these specific stocks. We are allowing them to make informed decisions on whether or not to buy stocks for potential short-term gains based on technical analysis. 

# Features:

    Bot in order to execute trades
    NLP to do sentiment analysis (if possible and time allows it)
    LSTM (as extra model)
    User friendly Interface
